Todo:

from slides:
- backup: when restoring allow entering a passphrase (to be compatible with Trezor)
- sync: preform automatic sync when app goes active (on active accounts only)
- accounts: do not allow another empty account (or more than the scan window)
- tap QR code to reduce brightness

- builder: try to sign tx to compute fees to avoid simulation when not needed.
- builder: randomize inputs and outputs when given a key or a specific random seed.
- sync after backup restore.
- sync after adding an account.
- sync: preform automatic sync of the active accounts
- sync: discover accounts by scanning first 20 addresses for each unknown account index within.
- settings: show credits and other info.
- sync: switch to another hostname on timeout.

Nice to have:
- accounts: show sending/receiving status too
- move "use all funds" into account details and/or settings.
- receive: remember last used currency and focus in the text field.
- send: remember last used currency and enable it.
- send: remember if scanned address last time to show scanner right away
- balance: new layout to better show balance, buttons; less emphasis on QR code and address
- update folder icon like in Health.app


Notes from talk with Andreas:
- testnet is poorly-connected to show unconfirmed txs, but quick to mine them.
- parent outputs are fetched to check amounts
- support entering password on init, but not on export
- android also stores irrelevant parent outputs, but not used.
- simple keychain usage for now without custom pincode UI.


Done:

+ handle bitcoin: URL when clicked in safari or elsewhere.
+ send: auto-jump to btc field after scanning QR
+ settings: spend from WIF private key (fetch all unspents and spend them to current account's change address).
+ show various errors when scanning QR codes

+ bug: when spending all funds, tx was not saved with -1 height and its parents were not properly fetched.
+ bug: stress-test when sync fails mid-way. Should display incomplete data without crashes and sync cleanly.

+ send: add address field and scan UI.
+ send: recognize bitcoin URI from QR code.
+ sync: save all parent outputs (for transaction details), mark our parents as ours in DB to avoid repeating checks.
+ send: compose transactions for sending.
+ sync: keep a reference to wallet.backend so if it changes from testnet to mainnet while in progress, it will connect to the same backend.
+ bug: not updating parent outputs correctly for just broadcasted transaction. Sync from scratch is correct, though.
+ transactions: show a list of transactions
+ transactions: details of a single transction
+ send: align amount inputs to the left, with extra line separators.
+ accounts: add account.
+ accounts: edit account label.
