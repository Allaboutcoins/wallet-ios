Notes from talk with Andreas:

- testnet is poorly-connected to show unconfirmed txs, but quick to mine them.
- parent outputs are fetched to check amounts
- support entering password on init, but not on export
- android also stores irrelevant parent outputs, but not used.
- simple keychain usage for now without custom pincode UI.
