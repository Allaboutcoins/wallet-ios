Todo:

Release Notes Beta 2:
— Fixed issues with exchange rate update (now updated on app activation and in Send/Receive screens)
— Improved labels for pending funds (Receiving/Sending without "...")
— Improved backup screen layout for iPhone 4S when keyboard is visible.
— Wording fix ("Master wallet seed" -> "master seed of your wallet'")
— "Main account" button is not displayed on balance view when there is only one account (easier on newcomers)

Bugreports:

+ on initial launch exchange rate is not up to date yet.
  - when trying to request payment for 1 USD, fails to compute correctly.
  - now we update exchange rate on app activation and every time we open Send/Receive screen.
+ Why do we need "..." after "receiving X btc"
  - because it shows that the coins are currently being sent
    and it will take some amount of time before they confirm.
- swiping
  - will conflict with swipe-to-back gesture
+ 4s: backupscreen: The keyboard covers the line where words supposed to appear.
+ "master wallet seed" -> "wallet's master seed"
+ balance: do not show main account if only one account is there

- send: crash when entering USD value when exchange rate is 0 or never updated.


Future todo:


- bug: when both sending and receiving coins, does not show separate sending and receiving status correctly.
- sync: switch to another hostname on timeout.
- accounts: show sending/receiving status too
- move "use all funds" into account details and/or settings.
- update folder icon like in Health.app
- switching between various exchanges
- switching between various fiat currencies
- switching currencies by tapping the fiat amount on the balance screen
- support for legacy mycelium backup format to sweep funds from legacy backups
- labels for transactions (also on send and receive)
- automatic backup for all metadata (account labels, tx labels, currency preferences)
- Touch ID / passcode protection at the moment of payment
- custom password protection for the seed
- local trader support
- offline peer-to-peer transaction sharing (with MC, Bluetooth or local wifi, to investigate)



Notes from talk with Andreas:
- testnet is poorly-connected to show unconfirmed txs, but quick to mine them.
- parent outputs are fetched to check amounts
- support entering password on init, but not on export
- android also stores irrelevant parent outputs, but not used.
- simple keychain usage for now without custom pincode UI.


Done:

+ fix the accidental crash when adding an account with a name in Russian.
+ crash: when adding a mainnet account with name "ваня"

+ change the balance view to only show the balance and buttons, no QR code or address.
+ balance: new layout to better show balance, buttons; less emphasis on QR code and address

+ txs:
+ show date bigger (and maybe denser) on the right
+ show amounts bigger on the left, aligned and padded
+ show currency switch on the top (BTC / USD)
