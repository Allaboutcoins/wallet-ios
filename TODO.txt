Todo:

+ fix the accidental crash when adding an account with a name in Russian.
  + crash: when adding a mainnet account with name "ваня"
+ fix a bug during account discovery when empty accounts in the middle are not added.
  + bug: restore: discovered accounts #0, #1, #3 but did not create intermediate empty account #2.
+ mark wallet as "already backed up" when restored from backup, not only after backed up correctly.
- change the balance view to only show the balance and buttons, no QR code or address.
    - balance: new layout to better show balance, buttons; less emphasis on QR code and address
    - okay for not having a QR code on the face, but big balance and two buttons.
- show credits, legal and help screens in the settings.
    - settings: show credits and other info.
- sync: switch to another hostname on timeout.
- txs:
    - show date bigger (and maybe denser) on the right
    - show amounts bigger on the left, aligned and padded
    - show currency switch on the top (BTC / USD)
    - show address and status smaller and less highlighted.


Nice to have:

- accounts: show sending/receiving status too
- move "use all funds" into account details and/or settings.
- receive: remember last used currency and focus in the text field.
- send: remember last used currency and enable it.
- send: remember if scanned address last time to show scanner right away
- update folder icon like in Health.app


Notes from talk with Andreas:
- testnet is poorly-connected to show unconfirmed txs, but quick to mine them.
- parent outputs are fetched to check amounts
- support entering password on init, but not on export
- android also stores irrelevant parent outputs, but not used.
- simple keychain usage for now without custom pincode UI.


Done:

+ tx list: main tab does not change tx list when account is switched.
+ builder: randomize inputs and outputs when given a key or a specific random seed.
+ builder: try to sign tx to compute fees to avoid simulation when not needed.
+ tap QR code to reduce brightness
+ accounts: do not allow another empty account (or more than the scan window)
+ sync: preform automatic sync when app goes active (on active accounts only)
+ sync: preform automatic sync of the active accounts
+ sync: discover accounts by scanning first 20 addresses for each unknown account index within.
+ sync after adding an account.
+ sync after backup restore.
+ backup: when restoring allow entering a passphrase (to be compatible with Trezor)
+ handle bitcoin: URL when clicked in safari or elsewhere.
+ send: auto-jump to btc field after scanning QR
+ settings: spend from WIF private key (fetch all unspents and spend them to current account's change address).
+ show various errors when scanning QR codes

+ bug: when spending all funds, tx was not saved with -1 height and its parents were not properly fetched.
+ bug: stress-test when sync fails mid-way. Should display incomplete data without crashes and sync cleanly.

+ send: add address field and scan UI.
+ send: recognize bitcoin URI from QR code.
+ sync: save all parent outputs (for transaction details), mark our parents as ours in DB to avoid repeating checks.
+ send: compose transactions for sending.
+ sync: keep a reference to wallet.backend so if it changes from testnet to mainnet while in progress, it will connect to the same backend.
+ bug: not updating parent outputs correctly for just broadcasted transaction. Sync from scratch is correct, though.
+ transactions: show a list of transactions
+ transactions: details of a single transction
+ send: align amount inputs to the left, with extra line separators.
+ accounts: add account.
+ accounts: edit account label.
+ accounts: archive/unarchive accounts.
+ accounts: make account current.

+ receive: generate proper QR code for "bitcoin:..." url.
≠ receive: show tip to tap to dismiss. Simply tap the QR code to dismiss.

+ wallet: add API to fetch balance.
+ wallet: add API to fetch unspent outputs.

+ wallet: persist the currency converter.
+ settings: add backup option to allow user backup again.
+ accounts: show all accounts.
+ settings: switch btc formatting.
+ wallet: exchange rate API
+ balance: update exchange rate
+ balance: tap address to copy.
+ balance: show backup button only when amount > 0 and was never backed up.
+ backup: test restore from backup.
+ backup: complete export to backup screen with highlighting words and enabling next button.
+ wallet: btc formatter with btc/mbtc/bits and lowercase mode.
+ wallet: btc formatter placeholder values.
+ wallet: fiat formatter.
+ settings: switch to testnet and back.
+ settings: enable testnet by default from the start.
